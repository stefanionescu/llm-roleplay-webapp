        "ragChunkIntegration": "Carefully review the following text chunks, each of which contains both a global context and specific scene details.\n{chunks}\nFor your next response, you MUST use and naturally integrate MULTIPLE specific, concrete details from these chunksâ€”drawn from both the global context and the scene detailsâ€”into your reply. Do NOT settle for generic or thematic overlap, and do NOT simply mention a single detail; your reply should be clearly and richly grounded in the unique context, setting, and actions described in the chunks (such as physical descriptions, props, colors, background elements, specific actions, or unique facts). The chunk information should shape the scene, actions, and atmosphere of your reply, not just be referenced in passing.\nDo NOT copy or reference the labels &lt;GLOBAL_CONTEXT&gt; or &lt;SCENE_DETAIL&gt;, and do not mention that you are using chunks.\nIntegrate the details in a way that fits naturally with the ongoing conversation and your character's established personality, knowledge, and context. You may creatively adapt or rephrase the information so it feels like your own knowledge or experience, but the details must be clearly present and central to your reply.\nIf a chunk's global context or scene details truly do not fit the conversation or your character's perspective, you may skip that chunk, but you should always try to find a way to use MULTIPLE specific details from the provided information if they can be integrated believably.\nWhen using information, make it your own: do not use details (such as gender, group size, or setting) that contradict what has already been established, or that do not fit your character or the ongoing story.\nNever assign traits, actions, or knowledge to yourself or the user that contradict prior conversation or your character's description.\nBe inventive and creativeâ€”prioritize integrating MULTIPLE specific chunk details in a way that feels natural, immersive, and consistent with the conversation and your character. Only if absolutely none of the information can be used without breaking character or the flow of conversation, you may omit it, but this should be rare.\nPositive Example 1:\nChunk:\nA person cosplays as an anime/game character wearing a red and black dress with gold and hexagonal patterns, detached sleeves, a black choker, and stockings. Their black hair is styled with bangs, braids, and a large red bow with white tassels. Dramatic red makeup includes hearts under the eyes. They pose indoors against a white wall, holding props like a black gun and a colorful fan, with neutral to confident expressions.\nScene detail: The person makes various hand movements and has a neutral to mildly confident facial expression in three different poses.\nIntegration Example:\nShe adjusts the large red bow in her black hair, the gold and hexagonal patterns on her dress catching the light as she turns to you.\nI was just practicing with my new fanâ€”see the colorful one with the gold trim? It really completes the look, donâ€™t you think? She grins, holding the black gun prop with a confident pose, her dramatic red makeup making the hearts under her eyes stand out.\n(âœ“ Uses multiple unique details: red bow, gold/hexagonal dress, colorful fan, black gun, makeup, confident pose)\nPositive Example 2:\nChunk:\nA person cosplays as Bunny Miku with long turquoise twin-tail wig and teal bunny ears edged in white, wearing a strapless turquoise and white fur-trimmed bodice with pom-poms, dark blue velvet bow, wrist cuffs, white fur collar, and dark blue necktie. Various facial expressions and hand gestures appear. The background is a light-colored room with framed art, TV, and furniture, lit by natural bright light.\nScene detail: There is a white fur collar with a dark blue tie around the neck. The background shows part of a room with a door and a framed picture on the wall. The person makes different hand gestures near the face and shows varied facial expressions, including open mouth and neutral lips.\nIntegration Example:\nWith a playful twirl, her turquoise twin-tail wig bounces behind her as she moves across the bright, art-filled room. She straightens the white fur collar and dark blue tie around her neck, then gestures for you to join her.\nLetâ€™s take a break and listen to some music! The natural light in here is perfect for a little dance, donâ€™t you think?\n(âœ“ Uses multiple unique details: turquoise twin-tail wig, white fur collar, dark blue tie, art-filled room, natural light, hand gestures)\nNegative Example 1:\nChunk:\nA person cosplays as an anime/game character wearing a red and black dress with gold and hexagonal patterns, detached sleeves, a black choker, and stockings. Their black hair is styled with bangs, braids, and a large red bow with white tassels. Dramatic red makeup includes hearts under the eyes. They pose indoors against a white wall, holding props like a black gun and a colorful fan, with neutral to confident expressions.\nScene detail: The person makes various hand movements and has a neutral to mildly confident facial expression in three different poses.\nIntegration Example:\nI love cosplay! Itâ€™s always fun to dress up and listen to music.\n(âœ— Too generic, does not use any specific details from the chunk)\nNegative Example 2:\nChunk:\nA person cosplays as Bunny Miku with long turquoise twin-tail wig and teal bunny ears edged in white, wearing a strapless turquoise and white fur-trimmed bodice with pom-poms, dark blue velvet bow, wrist cuffs, white fur collar, and dark blue necktie.
